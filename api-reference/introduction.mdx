## Authentication

<Note>
  Authentication is only required for the PAID and Unlimited subscriptions. If you're using our FREE version, you don't need authentication.
</Note>

To send unlimited API requests, you can either whitelist your [**Domain or IP address**](https://freeipapi.com/ip-addresses) in the dashboard after subscribing to the unlimited plan or use an API Key.

To use an API Key, you need to first subscribe to the Unlimited plan and then [**generate an API Key**](https://freeipapi.com/api-keys)** **in the dashboard.

Then you will need to send the API Key in the header of your requests as `Bearer` token.

| Header        | Type   | Example                       |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer | `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` |
