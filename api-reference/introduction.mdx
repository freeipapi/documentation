## Servers

FreeIPAPI provides servers across the globe to ensure low latency and high availability.

### Free Servers

Our free servers are networked under `free.freeipapi.com` and are available for everyone to use.

<Note>
    Rate limits will apply to the free servers.
</Note>

### Paid Servers

Here are the list of our servers for the paid plans:

| Server Name | Hostname           | Location      |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| US          | `us.freeipapi.com` | United States |
| DE          | `de.freeipapi.com` | Germany       |

## Authentication

<Note>
    Authentication is only required for the PAID and Unlimited subscriptions. If you're using our FREE version, you
    don't need authentication.
</Note>

To send unlimited API requests, you can either whitelist your [Domain or IP address](https://freeipapi.com/ip-addresses) in the dashboard after subscribing to the unlimited plan or use an API Key.

To use an API Key, you need to first subscribe to the Unlimited plan and then [generate an API Key](https://freeipapi.com/api-keys) in the dashboard.

Then you will need to send the API Key in the header of your requests as `Bearer` token.

| Header        | Type   | Example                       |
|---------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| Authorization | Bearer | `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` |
