Another way to use FreeIPAPIs unlimited API is to whitelist your servers IPs and domains. This allows you to make API requests without needing an API key, as long as the requests originate from the whitelisted IPs or domains.

## Whitelisting IPs and Domains

1. **Log in to your account**: Go to the [FreeIPAPI](https://freeipapi.com/login) and log in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to the IPs and Domains section**: Once logged in, go to the "IPs and Domains" section in your account dashboard.
3. **Add a new IP or domain**: Click on the "Create" button. You will be prompted to provide the IP address or domain name you want to whitelist.

<Warning>
    **Important**: Ensure that the IPs or domains you whitelist are secure and controlled by you. Any API requests made from these IPs or domains will be treated as authenticated requests, so it's crucial to keep them private and secure.
</Warning>

<Note>
    If you use this method, you will no longer need to use an API key to authenticate your requests.
