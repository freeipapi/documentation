FreeIPAPI allows you to generate and manage your API keys, which are essential for accessing the Paid APIs securely.

## Generating an API Key

1. **Log in to your account**: Go to the [FreeIPAPI](https://freeipapi.com/login) and log in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to the API Keys section**: Once logged in, go to the "API Keys" section in your account dashboard.
3. **Create a new API key**: Click on the "Create" button. You will be prompted to provide a name for your key and hit the create button.
4. **Copy your API key**: After the key is generated, copy it and store it securely. You will need this key to authenticate your API requests.

<Warning>
    **Important**: Keep your API key confidential. Do not share it publicly or expose it in client-side code. If you
    suspect that your API key has been compromised, regenerate it immediately.

    We will delete any API keys that we detect them being exposed in public repositories or client-side code.
